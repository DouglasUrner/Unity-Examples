# Unity Examples

## Common - for both 2D and 3D games

* [C# Basics][cb]
* [Sound Effects][se]

## 2D

* [Basic Player Controller][bpc] - a project to demonstrate the development of simple top-down 2D player (sprite) controller.
* [Player Controllers][pc]
* [Text Interaction][ti] - for games with "Adventure like" text based interaction.
* [Tilemap][tm] - creating 2D worlds using Unity's Tilemap.

Resources:

* [Sprites][] - A very simple sprite sheet for 2D prototypes.
* [2D Extras][2d-extras]

## 3D

### Character Setup and Animation

Creating a 3D animated character is a ***big*** undertaking - more than we can take on in this class. So, you have a couple of options:
1. Use a placeholder - maybe a capsule or a cylinder game object to stand in for the animated character.
1. Find a reasonably close model on the Unity asset store and use that.
1. Talk to Ms. Collins and see if there is someone in her 3D Modeling & Animation class who could help you.

Basically, what you're doing is finding an acceptable "stand in" and moving on - the actual character is probably not critical to the game concept at this point.

* [Adventure Game Tutorial][3D-adventure] - the first two segments are about moving the character.
